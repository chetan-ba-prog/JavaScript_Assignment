//3) Assuming that the Rectangle contructor takes a width and height, why does the following output 20 instead of 200?
//this keyword is used to differentiate between Global var and Local Var.

Rectangle.prototype.getAreaForRect = function(width,height)  //this is because of Global scope and LOcal scope.
{
    console.log("Getting Area using prototype property : " +width * height);
}

console.log(Rectangle.prototype);
myRect1.getAreaForRect(4,5); //calling method which is created using prototype property
myRect2.getAreaForRect(5,6);
myRect3.getAreaForRect(7,8);
myRect4.getAreaForRect(11,2);
